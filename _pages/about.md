Hello! I'm a data engineer with State Farm, interested in the intersection of data science, computer science and environmental engineering. I have previous experience in professional research at the Atmospheric Science Investigator Led Processing System (ASIPS), and academic experience from my Master's in Environmental Engineering from MIT. Outside of my full time position I'm currently working small projects in the climate space which are available on my [projects page](/projects/) and [repositories page](/repositories/).

I'm looking to get involved in larger scale open-source projects involving climate change, so please reach out if you have anything you think I might me able to help with! My core technical competencies include Python, Machine Learning, SQL and the Geospatial Toolkit.
